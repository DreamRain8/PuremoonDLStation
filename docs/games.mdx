<summary><b>Differences between versions</b></summary>

#### Play Version

Common version on Google Play released by Lowiro

- In-game purchases by Google Play;
- Built-in Play Games feature framework (basically equivalent to Game Center on iOS) to display the game's [Achievement System](https://wiki.arcaea.cn/%E6%88%90%E5%B0%B1%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F);
- **Even if your device doesn't have a Play Service Framework, you can still launch and play**.

#### Official website version

or C version (China), which is a special version provided by lowiro for players in Chinese mainland considering the actual situation in Chinese mainland.

- No built-in Play Games feature framework;
- In-game purchases will be directly directed to the recharge system on the Lowiro official website.

-----

The content of the two versions is **no different** and can be overwritten and installed without losing saves, or they can be upgraded directly.

:::caution Cautions

Since the download speed of the official website is not optimistic, **the Play version of our site is definitely faster than the c version update**.

If you want to get early access to new content, you can download the Play version before downloading the C version.

<summary><b>About the recharge of Memory</b></summary>

Since July 1, 2022, the Arcaea online recharge system has been officially opened to most regions. Now you don't need to download the C version installation package, you can go to the official account background to recharge the memory.

No matter which version of iOS/Play/c you are using, you can top up on the official website. **Alipay or WeChat Pay is supported in Chinese mainland.**

Online top-up address: [Click here](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/zh/account/purchase)

:::caution Cautions

## Social Card/Role Cultivation

Such games are music games with character cards and cultivation gameplay as the main core. Although they also have classic music game gameplay, their importance is not as high as that of traditional single-type music games.

Character cards are an important gameplay mechanism of the game. In the music game gameplay, the impact of character cards on the score is far higher than the judgment of the player's technical level (number of perfect judgments, number of Miss, number of combos, etc.).

Compared with music games, the experience of such games is more偏向为 RPG (role-playing games), but the combat/running elements are converted into music game gameplay.

However, such games still have situations where the player's music game strength is required (various difficult songs), and there are also rank assessment elements (such as Bang Dream!'s ex cards, PRSK's Kaimen, etc.), so ordinary music game players can also enjoy fun in them.
