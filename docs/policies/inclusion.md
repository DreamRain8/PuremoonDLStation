# Game Inclusion Standards

Provides a certain degree of explanation regarding the standards for including games and documents on this site.

## Details of Game Inclusion

1. This site **will only** include the following types of games on the [main site page](/)：

    - Those of the type generally recognized as "music games" ( "music game-like" games will not be included due to their controversial nature )；
    - Those whose content does not violate general laws and regulations and abides by public order and good morals；
    - Those for which obtaining resources is somewhat difficult in some regions；
    - Those whose main game is permanently free ( i.e., paid main games are not considered, such as *Cytus 2* )；
    - Those that have an Android platform client；
    - Those available from official websites, Google Play, TapTap, or other officially authorized channels.

2. On the basis of meeting the above conditions, this site **will not proactively** provide the following types of games on the [main site page](/)：
   - Pirated, cracked, optimized, or modified clients；
   - Modified clients used for private servers by players；
   - Modified clients used for custom charts；
   - Clients with modified resources, signatures, etc., without official authorization.

3. Unlike previous download site predecessors, this site will not include too many games for the following reasons：
    - Too many games may make it relatively inconvenient for you to search；
    - To a certain extent, it affects the aesthetics of the page；
    - It also burdens the site's resources ( storage space, bandwidth, etc. ), thereby increasing operating costs；
    - If you are looking for a navigation site containing most music games, you should check Google Play and the App Store instead; this site is just a download site.
    - ~~Currently, the operating costs are huge, and the download site cannot afford it~~

## Special Cases for Game Inclusion
