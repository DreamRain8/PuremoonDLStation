# Usage and Reposting Guidelines

> Last updated on March 17, 2025

This reposting guideline provides detailed explanations and supplementary extensions for the "reposting" and "usage" behaviors specified in [Terms of Service - User Behavior Restrictions](tos).

Please note that this reposting guideline is part of the [Terms of Service](tos) and may be revised at any time.


## Why is this guideline established?

To ensure the healthy and sustainable development of the download station, allowing it to thrive in the long run. Both we, as site operators, and you, as users, presumably do not want others to engage in hotlinking or crawling links every day, which would consume download resources, right?

Although we will never actively police you by telling you "don't repost" or publicly call you out, we still ask that you consciously abide by this guideline.


## Permitted Reposting Behaviors

1. Currently, you are free to forward and share the domain name of this site to other social platforms and communities.

   Example: You can tell your friends via Telgram or Telegram groups that there is a rhythm game download site called Puremoon Download Station, or post it on Bilibili dynamics or videos.

   **However, the following platforms are exceptions; you are not allowed to mention this site on:**
   - QQ Space;
   - QQ Kandian;
   - Short video platforms, such as Tiktok;

2. As a [public welfare project](https://github.com/DreamRain8/PuremoonDLStation), you are fully allowed to Fork this project or submit Pull Requests in accordance with open-source community rules; **however, directly cloning the project and making modifications without forking it is prohibited**;

3. You may send direct links to resources to others via **private sharing**.

   Example: If a friend is looking for the April Fools' version installation package of Phigros, you can directly send the download link from this site to them via private chat.

4. You may download resources to your local device and then share them through other means.

   Example: After downloading, upload to a cloud storage service and then share, or upload to your own server to create your own download link.


## Prohibited Reposting Behaviors

1. Corresponding to point 3 in the previous section, you are not allowed to directly send direct links to resources to public social platforms.

   Example: Directly posting the download link for the April Fools' version of Phigros on Tieba or Bilibili dynamics is prohibited.

2. You shall not crawl resources from this site through any technical means (e.g., scripts, crawlers).

3. You shall not engage in any form of profit-making activities by reposting links from this site.


## Reposting Behaviors Requiring Permission

To contact the operators of this site, please visit [Contact Information](../info/about).

1. If you are a site owner or content creator and need to repost content from this site to your own website, application, blog, video, or article, you must contact the operators of this site in advance and obtain consent.

2. For any reposting behavior that violates the prohibited items mentioned above, if you indeed wish to engage in such reposting with valid reasons, you must contact the operators of our site in advance and obtain consent.


:::caution To other downstream download sites

To prevent users of your site from suffering and to avoid disputes between both parties afterwards, I personally sincerely recommend that you **crawl the installation packages from this site to your own server and use download links from your own server on your site.** Of course, you can also find ways to directly capture packages from the Play Store.

:::caution To developers and content creators

You may repost or integrate content from this site into your website, application, article, or video, but **please be sure to inform me in advance before doing so; do not act first and seek permission later**. Additionally, due to some unpleasant incidents in the past, please be sure to clearly state your intentions when applying for reposting.

**Communication is the prerequisite for all cooperation, so please be sure to communicate with me in advance. Thank you for your cooperation.**
