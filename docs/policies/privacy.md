## Information Collection

To provide you with normal download services, **we will collect the following information about you based on the services you use:**

1. **Information automatically collected during your use of the services:** For functions such as browsing, searching, and downloading content, the collected personal information includes basic device information (including device model, operating system type and version number, browser User Agent (UA)), and log information (including your IP address, telecommunications provider). The correlation between information collected from your various devices is maintained to ensure that we can provide you with consistent services across these devices. Please note that separate device information, log information, etc., are information that cannot identify a specific natural person. If we combine such non-personal information with other information to identify a specific natural person, or use it in combination with personal information, during the period of combined use, such non-personal information will be regarded as personal information. Except with your authorization or as otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations, we will anonymize and de-identify such personal information. The above information is necessary for our platform to provide you with core functions.
2. **Information you provide to us:** In services such as questionnaires, social media private messages, and social media updates on this site, we will collect your responses to questions. Based on such information, we aim to understand your preferences and attitudes towards certain issues to provide you with personalized services.
3. **Information collected through indirect means:** Information about your interactive behaviors between our products/services and the products and services of our affiliates or partners when you use them. When you use the above services through our products or services, you authorize us to receive, summarize, and analyze your personal information or transaction information from our affiliated services, provided that we confirm the legality of their sources or you authorize them to provide such information to us, as needed. We undertake that we have confirmed the legality of the sources of the above personal information.
4. **Information collected using technologies such as Cookies:** The static webpage building tools we use automatically create Cookies to record your visits, but these Cookies will not record any of your personal information. Some of our services can only be realized through the use of Cookies. If your browser or browser add-on services allow, you can modify your acceptance of Cookies or refuse our Cookies, but this action may affect your secure access to the relevant websites of our platform and your use of the services provided by our platform in some cases.


## Information Use

We will collect and use your personal information for the following purposes stated in this Policy:

1. Service provision: To provide you with various services (content browsing and downloading), and to design, maintain, and improve these services. In service provision, only our relevant operational personnel can access your personal information to ensure that the website is not subject to hotlinking or crawling;
2. Risk identification: We may use your personal information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security hazards, illegal acts, or acts that violate agreements, policies, or rules with us or our affiliates, such as abnormal traffic, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of you, our other users, or us and our affiliates;
3. Protection of public interests: To protect the legitimate interests of you, our other users, or us and our affiliates.


## Information Storage

The information and data we collect about you will be stored on servers controlled, used, or leased by us and/or our affiliated companies. We will strictly maintain the confidentiality of your relevant data and control its use. Such information and data may be transmitted to, accessed, stored, and displayed in the country or region where you are located or where we collect the information and data.

We will take reasonably feasible measures to avoid collecting irrelevant personal information. **Under normal circumstances, we will only retain your personal information for 48 hours.** The above retention period is the shortest period necessary to achieve the purposes stated in this Policy, unless you agree to extend the retention period or it is permitted by law. After the expiration of the retention period, we will delete your personal information or conduct anonymization processing on it.

If the services of this platform decide to cease operations, we will stop collecting your personal information after the relevant services cease. We will notify you of the cessation of operations through an announcement. The personal information we already hold about you will be deleted or anonymized.

We are committed to maintaining appropriate technical and organizational security measures that meet industry standards to help protect your information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure, access, misuse, loss, or tampering. Although we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or guarantee its absolute security, as absolute security does not exist.


## Sharing, Disclosure, and Transfer of Information

We assume an obligation of confidentiality for your information and will not share your personal information with any other third party except in the following circumstances.

In the following cases, prior authorization and consent from you are not required for sharing, transferring, or publicly disclosing your personal information:

1. Matters related to national security and national defense security;
2. Matters related to public security, public health, and major public interests;
3. Matters related to criminal investigation, prosecution, trial, and execution of judgments.

According to legal provisions, sharing or transferring de-identified personal information, ensuring that the data receiver cannot restore or re-identify the subject of the personal information, does not constitute external sharing, transfer, or public disclosure of personal information. The storage and processing of such data will not require separate notification to you or obtaining your consent.


## Protection of Minors' Privacy

We attach importance to the protection of minors' personal information. If you are a minor under the age of 18, **it is recommended that you ask your guardian to carefully read this Privacy Policy and use our services or provide information to us only with the consent of your guardian.**

For the collection of minors' personal information when they use our products or services with the consent of their parents or guardians, we will only use, share, transfer, or disclose such information as permitted by local laws and regulations, with the explicit consent of parents or guardians, or as necessary to protect minors.


## International Transfer of Information

The personal information collected and generated during our operations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China is stored in the Republic of Singapore, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and the United States of America, with backups in the United States of America.

Please note that the information we collect (including personal information) will be transmitted, processed, and stored in these countries or regions. Therefore, in some cases, courts, law enforcement agencies, and other competent authorities in these countries or regions may have the right to access your personal information.

We conduct transfers only where permitted by applicable laws through contracts with recipients or other means to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place when information is transferred outside your country or region.

By using our services or providing us with any information through these services, you acknowledge that the transmission, processing, and storage of your information in these countries or regions may not be subject to privacy laws as comprehensive as those in the country or region where you reside or of which you are a citizen.

Our platform reserves the right to revise the Privacy Policy and will notify you through announcements on our platform or other appropriate means before the revised policy takes effect. In such cases, if you continue to use our services, it means that you have agreed to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy of our platform.
