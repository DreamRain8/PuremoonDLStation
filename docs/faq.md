## Site-related

### Chrome download page crashes

Chrome for mobile may sometimes experience a situation where you click to open the download page, then the page closes and the file cannot be downloaded. There are three solutions, you can choose one of them:

- Long press to copy the download link and paste the download link into the browser address bar or other download tool to open it;
- Clear the browser cache, force close the browser and reopen it;
- Switch to a different browser. (Recommended: [Edge](https://dl.chunyueyun.yilx.cc/软件%20Software/电脑%20PC/Microsoft%20Edge), [Via](https://viayoo.com/zh-cn/), etc.)

### iOS-related

If you are an iOS user, download the game you want to download on the App Store. **We will not be offering any iOS game downloads at this time. **

Some games are not available on the App Store in some regions, so you need to switch the region where the App Store is located. For information on how to sign up for an account in other regions of the App Store and download the game, [please refer to this tutorial](../blog/2025/03/19/appleid).

### Historical Versions and April Fool's Day Versions

All "April Fool's Day/Other Versions" resources on our site are derived from official historical versions, and **these versions cannot coexist with the latest version of the game**.

Before preparing to play these versions, you should make a backup of your game save and choose one of the following methods:①Uninstall the new version and install it;②Play on other devices.

We **do not recommend modifying the installation package to coexist with the latest version**.If your account is banned by the game company due to modifying the installation package, Puremoon will not be responsible.

### Game Version Updates

Because we can't always keep up with game updates,~~sometimes webmasters get lazy, and some games like to update early in the morning. I don't think there are really young people who can get up at 5 a.m.~~, so sometimes the game has been updated, but the download station still shows the old version link.
~~Pimeng: Actually, I occasionally check for game updates in the middle of the night ()~~
   
If the game installation package on the download station has become an old version, please send a private message to our official Bilibili account [Puremoon Rhythm Game Download Station](https://space.bilibili.com/673409542).

### Resource Inclusion

Currently, we're including resources based on the needs of the majority of players. However, **we will not be including too many resources for now**, as this would cause inconvenience to our site operations and your ability to find resources.

The basic inclusion criteria are: **the game package must be free** (Free-to-play) and **have an official release for the Android platform**. For more details, see [Inclusion Criteria](policies/inclusion).

If you'd like to submit resources for inclusion, not limited to rhythm games, please [submit your opinion here](https://f.wps.cn/g/jLQSJi0Z/). We'll check back periodically.

[Here](https://kdocs.cn/l/chn2fhPhiK36) is the review area. Submitted opinions will generally appear here, and if approved, they will be uploaded to the download station.

## Download-related

### Download Failure/Slow Download Speed

If you're unable to download or notice a slow download speed, you can try **canceling the task and clicking the download link again**, or **switching to an alternate download node**.

At the same time, you can use other download tools (e.g., IDM, Xunlei, etc.).

### Unable to open the installation package after downloading

This may be a browser bug. Please open the installation package in your phone's file manager.

## Game play-related

### Device support

Our site only includes Android games (desktop version Windows only).

Harmony OS (HUAWEI devices) and some Android custom OS (such as HyperOS) may not be able to play some games normally, so please test it yourself.

Unless otherwise specified, the installation packages included in our site by default are preferentially compatible with the 'arm64-v8a' architecture. Some older devices manufactured before 2018 may not be able to install such installation packages.

It's best to have your device's Android version not lower than 6.0, otherwise most games may not work properly.

### Installation in xapk format

Check out the tutorials below:

:::tip

**We recommend trying to install with [MT Manager](https://mt2.cn) first**

:::

- [Standard Version Installation Tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GT4y1Q7x7/), generally follow this method to successfully install xapk;
- If the installation fails (e.g., HyperOS) through the above method, please check out [Tutorial for installing in-depth customized ROMs such as HyperOS](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jR4y157WL/).

### Top-up

For games with in-game purchases, most require top-up via Google Play, unless the game officially provides other top-up methods (such as top-up through the official website).

If you are unable to top-up via Google Play, please consider using other top-up methods (such as top-up through a proxy).

### How to Play the Game

~~**Find your own guide, kora! **~~

### Data Download Issues

Card-based rhythm games generally require in-game data downloads, and some classic rhythm games also require downloading resources like music charts.

If in-game data downloads are too slow, consider using a VPN or other internet-connected tool.
