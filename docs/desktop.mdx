:::danger Warning

Although this site has reprinted some tutorials, you still need to operate the specific things by yourself. This site will only provide game downloads and reprinted tutorials.

There is no reason for our site to teach you how to play the game step by step.

:::

</details>

Currently, the main popular BMS players are Lunatic Rave 2 (LR2) and Beatoraja. For most players, either one can be used, and the gaming experience is not significantly different.

Beatoraja is relatively easier to configure and has better support for more modern operating systems and multiple languages; if your device configuration is relatively old (such as using a 32-bit operating system, with only 2GB of memory, etc.), you can try LR2.

### Beatoraja

:::tip Tip & Resource Mirror Description

Our site **strongly recommends** that you read the [Beatoraja Gameplay Tutorial](https://scelym.github.io/post/beatoraja-guide/) in advance to avoid unnecessary confusion.

The following resources are mirrors of https://bms.cosmiccat.top/, and you can also download from the original website.
